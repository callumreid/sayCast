# sayCast HUD (placeholder)

Electron/Vite overlay will live here. Initial scaffold will include:
- Frameless always-on-top window anchored to the top-right corner.
- IPC bridge to the core service for transcript + status updates.
- Tailwind/Chakra-free minimal styling, with color states (idle/listening/success/error).

Implementation pending once the core pipeline + native helper are wired.
